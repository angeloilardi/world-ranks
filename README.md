## Overview

![screenshot](./public/images/Screenshot%202025-05-12%20at%2017.26.47.png)

Web app with insightful data abot every single country in the world. What's the most populous country? What language do they speak? What currency do they use?

### What I learned

The biggest learning was how to best approach sorting and filtering of data. I used plain JS for this purpose but I might look for a library that does that in the future.
Another fun part was mastering TypeScript to make sure the app has a rock solid type safety in place.

### Useful resources

- [Formik documenttion](https://www.formik.org) - This made the form handling so much easier
- [NextJS Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching) - Making use of their native server-side data fetch

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org)
